# SpaceInvadersRemake

This is a remake made by me using Unity and was a test for (a gamestudio)[http://www.hoplon.com/site/]. Two features were added: Guided Missile and Piercing Shot. Both power ups are enabled when the cannon shots four times. There are other differences because not every detail from the original game was implemented the same.
